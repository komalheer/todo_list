Arithmatic Calculator:

My final project will be a calculator which will perfrom basic mathematical functions i.e 
'addition', 'subtraction', 'multiplication' and 'division'. 
It will be a web app that will use HTML, CSS and Javascript for functioning.
Further, this app can be expanded to scientific calculator which can perform scientific functions 
like square root, square etc.
Moreover, it can be upgraded to polynomial calculator.
Obviously, this calculator will be helpful to every student and other people.
It will be deployed using Netlify or surge but basically Netlify.
Also, It can be made a node app which can run on terminal.
I am making this calculator because mathematics is day-to-day part of our life.



Age Calculator App:

Another idea can be age calculator app which will calculate the age hours, minutes
and seconds.
The user needs to enter his/her date of birth and the app will convert the age to 
hours, minutes and seconds.


Calorie Calculator App:

Another Idea is a calorie calculator app will calculate the daily amount of calorie required 
by a person.
The app will calculate the calorie required according to age, height, weight and gender.
I want to develop this app because people are becoming more fitness freak.
Moreover, this app can be upgraded to diet planner tooin future. For example, According to the need of the 
user, app can provide the daily diet plan.
It will use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
